title: "SENSEflux"
summary: Spatially Explicit Nutrient Source Estimate and Flux model （SENSEflux） uses a GIS and mass balance approach to simulate nutrient fate and transport from point and nonpoint sources across the landscape through rivers to lakes and wetlands. It includes four components: (1) nutrient applications, (2) in situ losses, (3) basin attenuation through surface and subsurface pathways, and (4) stream and lake attenuation.

## Summary
The SENSEflux (Spatially Explicit Nutrient Source Estimate and Flux) model was developed by MSU Hydrogeology Lab at Michigan State University. This model uses a GIS and mass balance approach to simulate nutrient fate and transport from point and nonpoint sources across the landscape through rivers to lakes and wetlands. It includes four components: (1) nutrient applications, (2) in situ losses, (3) basin attenuation through surface and subsurface pathways, and (4) stream and lake attenuation.
