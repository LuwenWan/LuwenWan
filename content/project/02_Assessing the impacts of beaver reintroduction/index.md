title: Assessing the impacts of beaver reintroduction
Summary: This project seeks to develop tools for assessing these impacts, integrating topographic and remote sensing data with computer vision techniques. We aim to measure surface water storage, evaluate beavers' role in drought resistance and forest fire refugia, and devise methods for assessing floodplain water storage. The findings will support beaver reintroduction efforts and enhance ecosystem management.
