title: "Beaver pond mapping using NAIP"
date: "2024-12-02"
---
summary: This project aims to (1) delineate beaver ponds across diverse landscapes in the western United States using high-resolution (0.6 m) NAIP imagery via the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform, (2) create beaver pond complexes using density-based algorithms, and (3) identify important factors influencing surface water area variations in beaver wetland complexes.
