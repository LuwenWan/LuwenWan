abstract: "North American beavers (Castor canadensis) build dams and ponds that alter streamflow, enhance
floodplain water storage, and provide refugia during droughts and wildfires. However, drivers of pond
area variability remain poorly understood. Here, we quantified the influencing factors that drive pond
area and dam length variations using an explanatory modeling approach, after mapping surface water
area of beaver ponds and creating beaver pond complexes. Mapped area correlated well with manual
delineations (r2 = 0.89), and additive pond area and dam length across 87 complexes followed a
significant log-log scaling relationship. Dam length was the strongest covariate of pond area, while
woody vegetation height and stream power index were also influential; together, these covariates
explained 74% of the variation. Our results provide an empirical foundation to inform site selection and
prioritization for beaver restoration, supporting watershed management, climate resilience and
ecological conservation strategies in regions with comparable data availability and landscape
characteristics."
